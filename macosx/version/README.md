# Self-contained firmware-version check

This directory contains a script to build a self-contained helper tool for firmware version check.

It is designed for in-house testing and packaging and as such has little to no value for normal users. It requires Pyinstaller and assumes all dependencies for the flotilla Python API are met on the build system.
