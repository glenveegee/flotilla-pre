# Flotilla Pre-release

This is pre-release Flotilla software for pioneering pirates. Not for the faint of heart! You have been warned!

# What is it?

This software release is a concerted effort to align our ducks and produce a finely tuned, solid refinement to the Flotilla software stack.

It includes the Flotilla Firmware, Flotilla Daemon and the Rockpool front-end, polishing up the Python API will be a separate effort.

# What to expect in this release:

* Faster but potentially unstable Raspberry Pi Flotilla/Rockpool overhaul!
* pre-compiled Linux versions based on above
* Work in progress Mac version 
* Highly experimental Windows versions

# It doesn't work!

This is an experimental, cutting-edge release. Things can and will break.
