#Flotilla Pre-Release

This pre-release Windows version of Flotilla Rockpool contains the following:

* Rockpool + Flotilla daemon installed via a standard setup file
* Flotilla dock firmware updater

#Requirements

This pre-release has been tested on Windows 7 through to Windows 10. Official support for earlier versions of Windows is not on the card currently, sorry!

#Flotilla Firmware

The new daemon and Flotilla dock firmware speak 115200baud serial instead of 9600, they both need updating together.

To update your Dock, run the update batch script in the firmware folder and follow the instructions.

#Launching Flotilla/Rockpool

Once your dock firmware is up-to-date, and you have successfully ran the appropriate MSI to completion, simply double-click the desktop shortcut (or launch it from your Start menu). This will launch the Flotilla daemon and open the latest Rockpool web interface.
