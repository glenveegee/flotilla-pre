#Flotilla Firmware

To update your Dock, you will need the dock firmware and some specialist tools such as dfu-programmer.

You may either build dfu-programmer from source, or just use the latest pre-compiled version, which will work just fine. You can download it from here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/dfu-programmer/files/dfu-programmer/0.7.0/

If you wish to build it from source, the github repository can be found at:
